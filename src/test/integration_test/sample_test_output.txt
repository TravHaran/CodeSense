Q: Does this project have a multiplication capability?
querying codebase...
RESPONSE: 
Yes, this project does have multiplication capability. The `calc.rs` file defines a `Calc` struct with a method named `mul` that performs multiplication on vectors of floating-point numbers (`Vec<f64>`). This method multiplies all elements in the provided vector together. Additionally, the `main.rs` file handles user input and uses the `Calc` module to perform various arithmetic operations, including multiplication.

Q: does it have a square operation functionality?
querying codebase...
RESPONSE: 
Based on the provided context, the codebase does not include a square operation functionality. The `Calc` struct in `calc.rs` offers methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but it does not mention any support for squaring a number. 

To add such functionality, you would need to implement a new method, such as:

```rust
impl Calc {
    // Other methods...

    pub fn square(&self, x: f64) -> f64 {
        x * x
    }
}
```

You would also need to modify the `main.rs` file to handle the square operation input from the user.

Q: how would we modify the code to add a square function?
querying codebase...
RESPONSE: 
To add a `square` function to the existing `Calc` struct in `calc.rs`, you would define a new method called `square` in the `impl` block. This function will take a `Vec<f64>` and return a new `Vec<f64>` where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the input vector. Additionally, you will need to add a test case for this new function in the `test_all_operations` function.

Here is how you can modify the `calc.rs` file:

```rust
// Adding new square method to the Calc struct
impl Calc {
    // Existing methods: add, sub, mul, div

    pub fn square(numbers: Vec<f64>) -> Vec<f64> {
        numbers.into_iter().map(|x| x * x).collect()
    }
}

// Adding test case for the new square method
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_all_operations() {
        // Existing test cases for add, sub, mul, div

        // Test case for square
        let numbers = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0];
        let squared = Calc::square(numbers.clone());
        assert_eq!(squared, vec![1.0, 4.0, 9.0]);
    }
}
```

This modification includes a new method `square` that maps each number in the input vector to its square and collects the results into a new vector. The added test case verifies that the `square` method works as expected.
