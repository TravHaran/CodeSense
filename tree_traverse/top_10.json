These extracted keywords are then returned as a list.\n   \n2. **Text Processing and Word Embeddings**: The code reads and processes a context file, tokenizes the sentences into words, and uses the Gensim library's Word2Vec model to create word embeddings for these words.\n\n3. **Similarity Comparison**: With the `compare_words` function, the code computes the similarity between two words using the Word2Vec model, and `compare_keywords` function calculates the cumulative similarity score between two lists of keywords.\n\nThe code reads two input texts, extracts keywords from each, and computes the similarity score between the two keyword lists.

The primary functionalities include keyword extraction, codebase tree extraction, and annotation generation. Key components include Python scripts performing tasks such as keyword extraction from text using NLTK, creating a JSON model of a directory structure, modeling a video game character with defined attributes and methods, and employing the Hugging Face Transformers library for text generation. Additionally, there's an informative README detailing the project's breakdown and instructions for setting up the environment. The expected outputs involve generating keyword lists, JSON representations of directory structures, and textual annotations or summaries from provided codebases.",

Annotation Generation\\n    - for a fucntion defined in code generate a text summarization\\n### 4. Annotation Aggregation\\n    - for a source-code file modeled as a call graph with annnotations at each node, output an aggregated report of all the annotations\\n### 5. Keyword Extraction\\n    - from the aggregated annotation report extract a list of keywords\\n    - from a usery query extract a list of keywords\\n### 6. Tree Traversal\\n    - given a list of target keywords traverse the code-base tree until you find the node with the most matching keywords\\n    - once the target node has been found, return it's corresponding aggregated annotation report\\n### 7.

Hidden files and folders are ignored. If a directory is found, the function is called recursively; if a file is found, its content is read into the dictionary. The `file_to_string(file_path)` function reads and returns the contents of a file. The script specifies a folder path, calls the function to create the JSON structure, converts it to a JSON string with indentation, prints it, and saves it to a file named \"codebase.json\".

CodeBase Tree Extraction\n    - for a given codebase generate a k-ary tree outlining the directories, subdirectories, all the way down to the actual code files as the leaf nodes\n### 2. Call Graph Extraction\n    - for a source code file generate a directed graph representing the flow of execution calls for functions defined in the code file\n### 3. Annotation Generation\n    - for a fucntion defined in code generate a text summarization\n### 4. Annotation Aggregation\n    - for a source-code file modeled as a call graph with annnotations at each node, output an aggregated report of all the annotations\n### 5. Keyword Extraction\n    - from the aggregated annotation report extract a list of keywords\n    - from a usery query extract a list of keywords\n### 6. Tree Traversal\n    - given a list of target keywords traverse the code-base tree until you find the node with the most matching keywords\n    - once the target node has been found, return it's corresponding aggregated annotation report\n### 7. Question Answering\n    - given the aggregated annoation report as context, provide an answer to the user's query."

                "annotation": "The description refers to a C++ function maxProfit within a Solution class that calculates the maximum profit from a list of stock prices. Initially, it sets maxP to 0, representing the maximum profit. It then iterates through the prices from the second element to the end. For each element, if the current price is higher than the previous price, it calculates the difference (profit) and adds it to maxP. Finally, it returns maxP, representing the total accumulated profit from all consecutive buy-and-sell opportunities. This method effectively captures profit from each price increase in the stock prices list.",
                "content": "The maxProfit function is part of a C++ class Solution. It calculates the maximum profit that can be made from a list of stock prices (prices). The function follows these steps:\nNike is a sports apparel company. It's brand is recognized accross the country\nInitialize Profit: It initializes maxP, the maximum profit, to 0.\nIterate Through Prices: It loops through the list of prices from the second element (index 1) to the end.\nCalculate Profit: If the current price is higher than the previous price, it calculates the profit by subtracting the previous price from the current price and adds it to maxP.\nReturn Profit: The function returns the accumulated maxP as the maximum profit.\nOverall, this function implements a simple algorithm for finding the total profit from multiple price increases in a stock price list, where each increase represents a buy-and-sell opportunity."
